# Getting Started with Atomica
=====================================

Welcome to the Atomica project, a comprehensive repository of starter kits for working with various languages and frameworks across the smart contract ecosystem.

## Prerequisites
---------------

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (for JavaScript-based projects)
* Python (for Python-based projects)
* Rust (for Rust-based projects)
* Solidity compiler (for Solidity-based projects)
* Vyper compiler (for Vyper-based projects)

## Project Structure
-------------------

The Atomica project is organized into several directories, each containing a specific type of project:

* `contracts/`: Contains smart contract code in various languages, including Solidity, Vyper, and Rust.
* `scripts/`: Contains deployment and interaction scripts for the smart contracts.
* `interact/`: Contains interaction scripts for the smart contracts.
* `utils/`: Contains utility functions and constants used throughout the project.
* `docs/`: Contains documentation for the project, including architecture diagrams.
